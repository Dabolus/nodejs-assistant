# Google Assistant SDK: Node.js Samples

[![Open in Cloud Shell][shell_img]][shell_link]

The [Google Assistant SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/) lets you add hotword detection, voice 
control, natural language understanding and Googleâ€™s smarts to your devices. 
Your device captures an utterance (a spoken audio request, such as 
_What's on my calendar?_), sends it to the Google Assistant, and receives a 
spoken audio response in addition to the raw text of the utterance.
